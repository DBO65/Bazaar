# Mission Statement
The core vision for Bazaar is to create a safe and reliable online marketplace for UF students to buy, sell, rent and trade items and/or services.  The driving reason behind this is to mitigate scamming and unsatisfactory deals as much as possible.  Bazaar also knows most college students are not liquid in cash and so want to offer them a way to still get the item/services they desire by facilitating bartering betweens users on the app.  

Bazaar also aims to be as easily accessible and the experience of using Bazaar to be as easy and user friendly as possible. Striving to foster a trusted and supportive community where students can engage with one another, exchange goods and services, and support their peers. 

Finally Bazaar intends to ensure the security & integrity are always maintained. To ensure security and integrity are maintained authentication measures will be implemented alongside safe storage of user information and robust reporting features will be implemented to ensure the integrity of the app is not affected by bad actors.  

# Problem
The problem Bazaar is tackling is the current informal, untrustworthy marketplace that college students use to buy/sell items/services.  Some examples of this marketplace are Snapchat Story postings, Facebook marketplace postings, and GroupMe postings to name a few.  These marketplaces, despite being hosted by trustworthy sites, allow bad actors (E.g. Ticket scalpers and Scammers) to engage in and take advantage of UF students.  

Bazaar and seeks to solve is to create an app that allows users to be verified by their UF email to ensure that they are real people, and create an app that allows not only for transactions to take place but, unlike our competitors, allows for more informal transactions such as bartering to take place as well.
